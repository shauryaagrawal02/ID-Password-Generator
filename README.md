# ID-Password-Generator 
By Shaurya agrawal

It is a python programme from which we can generate our own ID Password by just writing our name and just telling how much lengthy password do you want.

# Project Overview

This project is a simple, two-part command-line utility for generating basic user credentials which is made by python. It first ask the user for their name to create a personalized, randomly numbered ID for(e.g., name@1234). After that, it generates a password, it allows the user to select the desired length and complexity like Letters, Letters+Numbers, or Letters+Numbers+Symbols.

# Features

1.Personalized ID Generation: The system allows the user's first name directly into the ID format (e.g., [Name]@[Random Digits]),it will make the output more relevant than a purely random string.

2.Random Number Suffix: It will automatically add a 4-digit random number to the name portion of the ID, for creating uniqueness across different users.

3.Custom Password Length: Users have control over the strength of their password by specifying the exact number of characters they required.

4.Three Complexity Tiers: This password generator has three clear complexity options: Letters only (L), Letters and Numbers (LN), and for maximum security Letters, Numbers, and Symbols (LNS).
